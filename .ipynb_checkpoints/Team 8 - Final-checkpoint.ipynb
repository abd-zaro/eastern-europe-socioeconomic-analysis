    "Eastern Europe is a loosely defined term that refers to the eastern part of Europe bordered to the east by the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Ural Mountains.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than 99% of the population in Eastern Europe is part of the Caucasian race, and most of the ethnic groups belong to the Slavic group. The principal religion in this region is Orthodox Christianity, while the second religion is Islam, where most of them are located in countries such as Albania. \n",
    "The landform of Eastern Europe is relatively simple, dominated by the Eastern European plains. The climate is mainly temperate. The land is rich in natural resources, mostly distributed on the plains of Eastern Europe.\n",
    "Most of the Eastern European countries have a temperate climate. Winter is severely cold, summer is warm, spring and autumn are shorter, and there is an annual temperature difference. Summer is rainy, moisture is mainly brought in from the North Atlantic by westerly winds, and the rainfall is about 500 mm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, Eastern European countries were influenced by communist and socialist movements post-WWII, which resulted in a shared history and similar problems such as poverty, corruption, and pollution. After the drastic changes in Europe and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, all Eastern European countries adopted the capitalist system, and some Eastern European countries joined the European Union and NATO. Despite these changes, Eastern European countries still lag far behind the rest of Europe on most economical indicators, which results in a lower standard of living in Eastern Europe compared to their Western European counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the long-lasting effects of soviet-era influence on eastern Europe is the high level of contamination and pollution resulting from the lack of industrial control. In the 1990’s Eastern Europe was considered to be the world’s most polluted region. Vegetables were considered a treat because of the high population levels that affected the soil preventing the countries from using its forests and excellent agricultural resources. Today the region still has higher than average pollution rates despite the more sustainable practices implemented by Eastern European countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fall of the Soviet Union resulted in a period of instability for Eastern Europe during the late ’80s and ’90s. A combination of revolutionary efforts calling for democratization along with ethnic and religious wars resulted in the splitting of Eastern Europe into smaller countries with a relatively small population. An example of this splitting process is the former country of Yugoslavia, which disintegrated into five independent states (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Bosnia & Herzegovina) with less than 10 million in population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that we approach to complete was first clean the data by filtering the data we are the most interested in Eastern Europe, after that and based on the research we made, we were able to settle that the most critical features of our region were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-\tTotal population \n",
    "2-\tCO2 emissions (metric tons per capita)\n",
    "3-\tGDP per person employed (constant 2011 PPP $)\n",
    "4-\tIncome share held by lowest 20%\n",
    "5-\tEmployment to population ratio, 15+, total (%) (modeled ILO estimate)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we continue by doing another filter only for those specific attributes. Once we had the table with the features needed, we analyze our Datasets by using the .describe() and .info(), then we localize the number of missing values that we have per column.\n",
    "\n",
    "After inspecting our dataset, we were able to drop five countries from our data that do not match the geographical definitions of an Eastern European country, which are Sweden, Andorra, Norway, San Marino, Greece, and Kosovo, which is not recognized as an independent country. \n",
    "\n",
    "After dropping those countries, we count again the missing values reducing to 5 for the column 'Income share' so, we had the choice to replace them with the median or the mean, which will replace all the missing values with the data previously calculated. In our case, we decided to choose to substitute the missing values with the median since the mean is going to be less affected by inserting new values. To prove that we made the correct substitutions, we were able to run again those missing values, and we found out that there was 0 for the column, so we made sure that we do not have any more missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our datasets, we were able to make this analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "CO2 emissions Distribution has a mean of 6.94 and a median of 6.34\n",
    "We were able to identify that the country with the highest CO2 emissions is Estonia over 13 metric tons per capita and the one with less CO2 emissions is Albania with around 1.50 and a range of 11.30.\n",
    "Comparing the average of European region against the world, we notice that CO2 emission per capita in eastern Europe is higher than the world average (green line), the data shows that our region is experiencing pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the GDP per person employed distribution standpoint, we found a median of 52,586 and a mean of 51,102. The country with the highest GDP per person employed is Finland with 88,767 and the one with the lowest GDP per person employed is Albania with 2,475.\n",
    "Even though the mean and median GDP per capita of Eastern Europe is higher than the world average, by comparing with the Western European region we see that the average is almost double that of Eastern Europe, which is an indicator of the current economic situation of the region\n",
    "\n",
    "Total population distribution has a median of 3,480,915 and a mean of 6,222,782. The country with the highest total population is Poland with 38,125,759 and the lowest total population is Malta with 409,379.\n",
    "Our data is skewed to the right with Poland being an outlier with more than 30 million people compared to the regional average of around 6 million, the relatively small population of the region is a result of the independence movements that happened over the past decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our fourth point of the analysis is employment with a median of 49.72% and a mean of 49.53%. From our analysis, we found that the country with the highest employment-population is Estonia with 58% and the lowest employment-population in Bosnia and Herzegovina with 37%. \n",
    "Our region has a lower employment ratio average compared to the rest of the world including western Europe due to labor weakness meaning that people are not enough to qualify for the jobs, this high ratio contributes to the increasing number of immigration to western Europe, being a reflection of the economic situation and the standard of living in eastern Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our last point is the income share with a median of 88% and a mean of 8.5%. For the income statement, the country with the highest income share is Slovenia with 10.2% and the lowest income share is Latvia with 6.1%.\n",
    "By overlaying our graphs before and after imputing the missing values for the income share using the median, we notice a change in the shape of the distribution which is due to the higher mode. \n",
    "We can’t rely too much on this and use it as the main factor in the income share data since have a lot of data imputed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing the interquartile range and the box plot for each of the features, we found out that Croatia and Poland are the countries that are the best representation of our region on average.\n",
    "From these results, we decided to choose Croatia as our country that most resembles an average Eastern European country. We decided not to choose Poland because of the high population of the country which is uncharacteristic for an Eastern European nation. We can obviously notice from the boxplot and the histograms that Poland is an outlier when it comes to population.\n",
    "Finally, It should also be noted that the data for the income share of the lowest 20% for both Croatia and Poland were imputed using the median of the region therefore using these values for comparison would not give us any useful insights.\n"
